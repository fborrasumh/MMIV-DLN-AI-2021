# Getting started

## Software installation
* We highly recommend that you install the Anaconda Python distribution on your computer. Instructions here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.

## Learning material
* If you haven't used Python before we recommend that you use DataCamp via the link shared in the course welcome email (the link gives you free access).
* For a basic introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eCHD6f_phE and the many tutorials you'll find via Google. 
* Go through the course repo and have a look at the various Jupyter Notebooks already available. Feel free to try running them yourself. 
* Reading a bit about the [Team project](../team_project) is recommended, to get a head start. 

## Asking questions / troubleshooting

Use the course Discord server. It's best if you post in the #general channel so that you can help each other. @Alexander, @Arvid, @Peder and @Barath\_hn will also be available throughout the course.
