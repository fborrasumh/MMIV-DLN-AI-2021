# Deep learning

This module will give a quick introduction to some core features of deep learning, provide hands-on experience with image-, text- and graph-based applications, and do a guided tour of some useful tools and techniques of practical deep learning in biotechnology and medicine. 

The module has two parts:

### Part 1 
Part 1 will be an introduction to deep learning essentially from skratch. The main takeaway and learning outcome will be that
> _Deep learning is a search for good hierarchical representations..._

...that makes a given task easy to solve. The goal is to have everybody on board with this useful description of deep learning, and also to provide hands-on experience with how this translates into computer code (using PyTorch) via some concrete, simple examples.

### Part 2
In Part 2 we'll change gears and fly through some more involved examples. The goal is to expose you to some of the many ideas, techniques and tricks in modern deep learning. Those of you who are new to the field will hopefully get a useful impression of practical deep learning, with some pointers for learning more. Others more experienced in deep learning will perhaps learn some new tricks, and be exposed to some interesting approaches and applications. 

## Notebooks

### Part 1
* `DL-Example-1-MedNIST-using-PyTorch.ipynb`. This notebook will provide a translation of the lecture's description of deep learning into PyTorch code, using a simple image classification example (the MedMIST data set collected by Dr. Bradley J. Erickson). <br><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/MMIV-ML/MMIV-DLN-AI-2021/blob/master/1-deep_learning/DL-Example-1-MedNIST-using-PyTorch.ipynb">

</a>

* `DL-Example-2-MedNIST-MURA-using-fastai.ipynb`. This notebook repeats the above story by using more advanced image classification techniques, and also extends it to a much more difficult data set. Working through this notebook will give you a useful reference point for your further exploration of deep learning, and provide a bridge to the more advanced examples of Part 2.<br><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/MMIV-ML/MMIV-DLN-AI-2021/blob/master/1-deep_learning/DL-Example-2-MedNIST-MURA-using-fastai.ipynb">
