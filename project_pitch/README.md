# About the project pitch

Imagine that you're participating in a quick-fire session where research funding agencies or investors are screening ideas for potential financial support. 

At the event, each participant gets _5 minutes_ to pich an idea. If you pass the screening process then you move on to a second round where a more extensive, written project description is assessed(*).

Here's how your pitch should be framed:

> Given what you now know about the course, do you have any ideas, either concrete or more like visions, for how you could incorporate the topic(s) in your own PhD project or research? If not, then how about your field more broadly?
 
---
(*) _You'll get some practice with writing such descriptions in the course [Team Project](../team_project)._


## Requirements
* As long as you can give us your pitch via Zoom itâ€™s up to you how you do it. Slides, video, animations, you decide.
* _Feasibility:_ Add 2-3 literature references to indicate that your idea is feasible.

## Practicalities
* You'll present your pitch for the lecturers and your fellow students of the course. See the course schedule.
* The presentation order will be random and shared through Discord.
* We will stop you after 5 minutes to leave ~1 min for questions and for swapping to the next speaker.
